## **🚀 Next Steps & Future Improvements** 
Our implementation utilizes ResNet50 and EfficientNet-B0, but there may be specialized models for medical imaging that may perform better. 
With more time, we would find the optimal hyperparameters and perform more robust k-fold cross-validation. With more resources, we would seek feedback from dermatologists to understand potential clinical application of our model.
Some techniques we could further explore are image augmentation techniques and incorporating metadata about the patient
